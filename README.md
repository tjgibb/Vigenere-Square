# Vigenere-Square
Just a place for my first year crypto project, building a vigenere square cipher

Updated Dec. 2015, turns out it was somewhat broken, so I had to update a bit.

The coolest thing about the Vig square is that it can be used to make what's called a "one-time pad", or a literaly uncrackable code.
In fact, it has been proven mathematically that if the length of the key is the same length as the message, and is only used once
then it can never be broken. Because there is a virtually infinite number of possible translations of the message, including every wrong
one.That's why the vig square is so cool. With the proper input, it can be unbreakable. This isn't a cracking program by the way,
that's my next project.
